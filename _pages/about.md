I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at University of Southern California advised by Doctor [Shahram Ghandeharizadeh](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ghandeharizadeh/Shahram). 
As member of [FLS Lab](https://www.flslab.org/), I am deeply involved in building the next generation 3D-display using Flying Light Specks (miniature drones).
My research interest lies in drones, robotics, multi-agent system, Reinforcement-Learning, simulation, machine learning.
